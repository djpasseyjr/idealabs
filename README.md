Work Projects For Resume

  This folder includes code written while a research assistant at BYU-Idea Labs. Most of the code is centered around
 developing a discrete time perturbation for controlled dynamic systems.
A key part of the process was creating a transfer function with poles within the unit circle. (For stability.)
Much of the attached code and graphs deal with this aspect of the problem and tests the sizes of various parameter
solutions.

   Please glance through exploring-reachability.pdf for an example of my mathematical thinking and writing.
   
   For my work on optimizing a clustering algorithm see fasterIpsort.ipynb.
